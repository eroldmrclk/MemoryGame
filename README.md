# MemoryGame
*I made Memory game with sport object, which is played by millions of people around the world, in 2018 to gain Javascript, HTML and CSS experiences. Written at the introductory level, this code can be a source of inspiration for those who are new to Javascript, HTML and CSS.*

## About the Game
*We have to match 16 different sports objects in total. The game is set to 60 seconds by default. Those who successfully complete the game within 60 seconds will receive a "Congratulations!" message, while those who cannot complete it will receive a "Time is up" message.*
